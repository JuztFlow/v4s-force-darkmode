# v4s-force-darkmode
A simple tampermonkey script that forces darkmode on the admin page of vision4s.

## How-To

Follow these two simple steps:

1. Install the [tampermonkey browser extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/?locale=en) in order to be able to run userscripts on page load.

2. Click on the following link and tampermonkey should automatically detect it as a userscript and give you the option to "Install" or "Re-Install" or "Update" it:
   - [INSTALL: vision4s Admin Force Darkmode Tampermonkey Script](https://github.com/JuztFlow/v4s-force-darkmode/raw/main/v4s-force-darkmode.user.js)

If it does not automatically detect the userscript and shows you white background with simple black text, you probably did not install or activate tampermonkey correctly, or you maybe use a script-blocking addon like "NoScript".
