# v4s-force-darkmode
A simple tampermonkey script that forces darkmode on the admin page of vision4s.

## How-To

Follow these three simple steps:

1. Install the [tampermonkey browser extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/?locale=en) in order to be able to run userscripts on page load.

2. Activate "Developer Mode" in your browser extensions page (usually in the top right corner of the Extension Overview page), otherwise tampermonkey won't work! See https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q209 if you need a tuorial on how to do that and for more info.

3. Click on the following link and tampermonkey should automatically detect it as a userscript and give you the option to "Install" or "Re-Install" or "Update" it:
   - [INSTALL: vision4s Admin Force Darkmode Tampermonkey Script](https://github.com/JuztFlow/v4s-force-darkmode/raw/main/v4s-force-darkmode.user.js)

If it does not automatically detect the userscript and shows you white background with simple black text, you probably did not install or activate tampermonkey correctly, or you might be using a script-blocking addon like "NoScript".
